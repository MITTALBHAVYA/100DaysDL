# Simple Perceptron Classifier

This project builds a **Perceptron Model** from scratch and **visualizes the decision boundary** for a classification task.

## **How It Works**
1. Generates a dataset with **100 points** using `make_classification()`.
2. Plots the data with **two different colors**.
3. **Trains a Perceptron** model to classify the points.
4. **Draws a decision boundary** separating the two classes.

## **Installation**
Make sure you have Python and install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

Usage

Run the script:

python perceptron.py

What You Will See

    A scatter plot showing data points.
    A red line (decision boundary) separating two classes.

Limitations

    The Perceptron only works if data is linearly separable.
    Does not work well for complex patterns.

Improvement Ideas

    Try adding StandardScaler() for feature scaling.
    Test different learning rates (lr).
    Use Logistic Regression for non-linearly separable data.

## **Flaws in the Code (Learning Points)**
1. **Perceptron May Not Converge Always**  
   - If data is **not linearly separable**, the perceptron will **never stop updating weights**.
   - Solution: Use **Logistic Regression** or **SVM**.

2. **Random Sample Selection**  
   - The perceptron picks **random points**, which may cause inconsistent results.
   - Solution: Use **batch training** instead of picking random points.

3. **No Feature Scaling**  
   - Perceptron works **better if features are scaled** (e.g., between -1 and 1).
   - Solution: Use `StandardScaler()` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.

4. **Limited to a Straight Line**  
   - The perceptron can **only draw a straight-line boundary**.
   - If the data is **not separable with a line**, the model **fails**.
   - Solution: Use **SVM with kernel tricks** for complex data.

## **How to Fix These Issues**
### **1. Use Feature Scaling**
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
intercept_, coef_ = perceptron(X_scaled, y)

2. Use Logistic Regression for Better Results

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
