# Dropout Classification Example

This repository contains a neural network model demonstrating dropout regularization for classification tasks using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview
Dropout is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. This example showcases how dropout is applied in a classification model to improve generalization performance.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook dropout_classification_example.ipynb
   ```

2. Execute the cells step by step to:
   - Load and preprocess data
   - Define and compile the neural network
   - Train the model with dropout regularization
   - Evaluate and visualize the results

## Dataset
The notebook uses a synthetic or standard classification dataset (e.g., from `sklearn.datasets`) to demonstrate the impact of dropout.

## Model Architecture
The neural network consists of:
- Fully connected layers with ReLU activation
- Dropout layers to randomly disable neurons during training
- Softmax activation in the output layer for classification

## Results & Observations
The notebook includes visualizations of training performance, showing how dropout prevents overfitting and improves generalization.
