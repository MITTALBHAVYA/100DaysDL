## **Code Breakdown**
This Python script performs the following tasks:

1. **Importing Libraries**  
   - `numpy`, `pandas` → Used for numerical operations and data handling.  
   - `seaborn`, `matplotlib.pyplot` → Used for data visualization.  
   - `Perceptron` from `sklearn.linear_model` → Implements a perceptron classifier.  
   - `plot_decision_regions` from `mlxtend.plotting` → Visualizes decision boundaries.  

2. **Loading the Data**  
   - Reads `placement.csv` into a DataFrame (`df`).  
   - Prints the shape of `df` and displays the first few rows.  

3. **Visualizing the Data**  
   - Uses `sns.scatterplot()` to create a scatter plot of CGPA vs. Resume Score, colored by placement status (`placed`).  

4. **Preparing Data for Perceptron Model**  
   - `X` (features) consists of the first two columns (`cgpa` and `resume_score`).  
   - `y` (labels) is extracted from the last column (`placed`).  

5. **Training the Perceptron Model**  
   - `p.fit(X, y)` trains the perceptron on `X` and `y`.  

6. **Retrieving Model Parameters**  
   - `p.coef_` → The learned weights.  
   - `p.intercept_` → The learned bias.  

7. **Visualizing Decision Boundaries**  
   - Uses `plot_decision_regions()` to plot the model’s decision boundary over the dataset.

# Perceptron-Based Placement Prediction

This project implements a **Perceptron** model to classify student placement status based on **CGPA** and **Resume Score**.

## **Dataset**
The dataset (`placement.csv`) consists of:
- `cgpa` (float) - Cumulative Grade Point Average  
- `resume_score` (float) - Resume evaluation score  
- `placed` (int: 0 or 1) - Whether the student was placed (1) or not (0)  

## **Requirements**
Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn mlxtend
```

## **Usage**
Run the script:

```python
python perceptron_placement.py
```

### **Steps in the Script**
1. **Loads Data** - Reads `placement.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Visualizes Data** - Plots a scatterplot of CGPA vs. Resume Score, colored by placement status.
3. **Trains a Perceptron Model** - Uses Scikit-learn’s Perceptron to classify placements.
4. **Extracts Model Parameters** - Prints model weights and bias.
5. **Plots Decision Boundaries** - Uses `mlxtend` to visualize the perceptron’s decision boundary.

## **Example Output**
- A scatterplot of data points.
- A decision boundary plot showing the model’s classification.

## **Limitations**
- The Perceptron only works for **linearly separable** data.
- It doesn’t perform well on complex datasets.
- No feature scaling is applied.

## **License**
This project is for educational purposes.

## **Flaws & Learning Opportunities**
Here are some **flaws** in the code and ways to improve it:

1. **Lack of Data Preprocessing**  
   - No handling of missing values (`df.isnull().sum()` should be checked).  
   - Feature scaling (e.g., `StandardScaler()`) is missing, which could affect perceptron performance.  
   - Perceptron models are sensitive to unscaled data.  

2. **Perceptron Model’s Limitation**  
   - The Perceptron **only works if the data is linearly separable**.  
   - If the data is **not linearly separable**, the model will **not converge** (it will keep making updates forever).  
   - Consider using **Logistic Regression** or **SVM** for better results.  

3. **No Model Evaluation**  
   - The code trains the model but **doesn’t evaluate it** (e.g., accuracy score).  
   - `from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score` should be used to check model performance.  

4. **Hardcoded Column Indexing**  
   - Instead of `df.iloc[:, 0:2]` and `df.iloc[:, -1]`, explicit column names should be used (`df[['cgpa', 'resume_score']]`).  

5. **Possible Class Imbalance**  
   - If `placed` has an imbalanced distribution, accuracy alone isn't enough.  
   - Consider using metrics like **F1-score** or **ROC-AUC**.  

6. **Plot Decision Boundary Before Training**  
   - The `plot_decision_regions()` function should be called **after ensuring that training was successful**.

## **Improvements**
### **1. Scale the Data**
Modify your code like this:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

p.fit(X_scaled, y)
plot_decision_regions(X_scaled, y.values, clf=p, legend=2)
```

### **2. Evaluate Model Performance**
```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

y_pred = p.predict(X_scaled)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y, y_pred)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

### **3. Handle Non-Linearly Separable Data**
```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC

model = SVC(kernel='rbf')  # Using a non-linear kernel
model.fit(X_scaled, y)
plot_decision_regions(X_scaled, y.values, clf=model, legend=2)
```
